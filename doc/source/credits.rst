ExactPack was developed by the Verification team (XCP-8) at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.  Scott Doebling had the original idea to collect
exact solution codes under a uniform python API.  The initial
implementation was done by Daniel Israel and Robert Singleton.
Additional authors and contributors of codes incorporated into the
package will be listed on this page.
