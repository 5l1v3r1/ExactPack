ExactPack Contrib Directory
---------------------------

The "exactpack/solvers" directory contains only solvers that are
supported by the ExactPack team.  This means they are fully vetted,
and include documentation and unit testing as required by the
ExactPack manual.

The "exactpack/contrib" directory is the proper home for solvers
which are provided as-is and use at your own risk.  This is also the
location for solvers provided by third party developers, which have
not yet been accepted into the supported ExactPack suite in the
"solvers" directory.  For support for solvers in the "contrib"
directory, contact the contributor named in the relevant source file.
