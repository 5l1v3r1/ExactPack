"""Unit testing for ExactPack.

Although (or, perhaps, because) one important use case for ExactPack
is for generating solutions to use in verification of other codes,
ExactPack itself needs to be tested.  The modules in
:mod:`exactpack.test` contain python :py:mod:`unittest` test cases
designed to self-test the library.
